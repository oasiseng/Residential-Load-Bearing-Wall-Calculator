## Usage

1. Enter the wall height, supported load, and select options for spacing, wood species, and wall type.
2. Click **Calculate** to view results.
3. If the wall height exceeds 8ft, a note suggests adding mid-height blocking.
4. For heights over 12ft, a warning advises professional engineering review.
5. Use the **Reset** button to clear inputs.

### Example

- Wall Height: 10 ft
- Supported Load: 1000 plf
- Stud Spacing: 16"
- Wood Species: Douglas Fir-Larch No. 2
- Wall Type: Interior

**Result:** Might require a 2x6 stud, with status "Meets Requirements" (depending on calculations).

## Technical Details

- **Calculations:** Based on NDS 2018 for axial compression capacity, adjusted by column stability factor (Cp) for height. Exterior walls apply a conservative 20% reduction for bending moments (simplified; actual wind analysis recommended).
- **Prescriptive Check:** Aligns with IRC Table R602.3(5) limits where applicable.
- **Limitations:** Does not account for eccentric loads, shear, or full combined stress checks. For complex scenarios, use professional software.
